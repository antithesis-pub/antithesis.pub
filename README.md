# [Antithesis.pub](https://antithesis.pub)

This website will require following pages/sections (in no particular order):

- Article Pages
    - References support
    - Progress bar?
    - Advanced formatting support, pull quotes, image support
- Slug support for relative links within the site
- Advanced image support (carousels, flex containers)
- Home Page with slick graphics
- Contact Page + mailing list support
- About Page with Editorial Staff
- Eventually:
    - Submissions page with pipeline for storing and keeping track of submissions with mixed media support.

## More Considerations
- Accesibility? What is that and how do we handle it? 

Just had a great idea for an animation of two opposing arrows that merge and then reveal the name of the magazine Antithesis under it.
