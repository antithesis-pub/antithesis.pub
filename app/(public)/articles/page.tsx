              I cannot understand the people who take literature seriously; but I can
              love them, and I do. Out of my love I warn them to keep clear of this
              book. It is a collection of crude and shapeless papers upon current or
              rather flying subjects; and they must be published pretty much as they
              stand. They were written, as a rule, at the last moment; they were
              handed in the moment before it was too late, and I do not think that
              our commonwealth would have been shaken to its foundations if they had
              been handed in the moment after. They must go out now, with all their
              imperfections on their head, or rather on mine; for their vices are too
              vital to be improved with a blue pencil, or with anything I can think
              of, except dynamite.

              Their chief vice is that so many of them are very serious; because I
              had no time to make them flippant. It is so easy to be solemn; it is so
              hard to be frivolous. Let any honest reader shut his eyes for a few
              moments, and approaching the secret tribunal of his soul, ask himself
              whether he would really rather be asked in the next two hours to write
              the front page of the <em>Times</em>, which is full of long leading articles,
              or the front page of <em>Tit-Bits</em>, which is full of short jokes. If the
              reader is the fine conscientious fellow I take him for, he will at once
              reply that he would rather on the spur of the moment write ten _Times_
              articles than one <em>Tit-Bits</em> joke.

               Responsibility, a heavy and cautious
              responsibility of speech, is the easiest thing in the world; anybody
              can do it. That is why so many tired, elderly, and wealthy men go in
              for politics. They are responsible, because they have not the strength
              of mind left to be irresponsible. It is more dignified to sit still
              than to dance the Barn Dance. It is also easier. So in these easy pages
              I keep myself on the whole on the level of the _Times_: it is only
              occasionally that I leap upwards almost to the level of _Tit-Bits._

            <p>
              I resume the defence of this indefensible book. These articles have
              another disadvantage arising from the scurry in which they were
              written; they are too long-winded and elaborate. One of the great
              disadvantages of hurry is that it takes such a long time. If I have to
              start for High-gate this day week, I may perhaps go the shortest way.
              If I have to start this minute, I shall almost certainly go the
              longest. In these essays (as I read them over) I feel frightfully
              annoyed with myself for not getting to the point more quickly; but I
              had not enough leisure to be quick. There are several maddening cases
              in which I took two or three pages in attempting to describe an
              attitude of which the essence could be expressed in an epigram; only
              there was no time for epigrams. I do not repent of one shade of opinion
              here expressed; but I feel that they might have been expressed so much
              more briefly and precisely. For instance, these pages contain a sort of
              recurring protest against the boast of certain writers that they are
              merely recent. They brag that their philosophy of the universe is the
              last philosophy or the new philosophy, or the advanced and progressive
              philosophy. I have said much against a mere modernism. When I use the
              word “modernism,” I am not alluding specially to the current quarrel in
              the Roman Catholic Church, though I am certainly astonished at any
              intellectual group accepting so weak and unphilosophical a name. It is
              incomprehensible to me that any thinker can calmly call himself a
              modernist; he might as well call himself a Thursdayite. But apart
              altogether from that particular disturbance, I am conscious of a
              general irritation expressed against the people who boast of their
              advancement and modernity in the discussion of religion. But I never
              succeeded in saying the quite clear and obvious thing that is really
              the matter with modernism. The real objection to modernism is simply
              that it is a form of snobbishness. It is an attempt to crush a rational
              opponent not by reason, but by some mystery of superiority, by hinting
              that one is specially up to date or particularly “in the know.” To
              flaunt the fact that we have had all the last books from Germany is
              simply vulgar; like flaunting the fact that we have had all the last
              bonnets from Paris. To introduce into philosophical discussions a sneer
              at a creed’s antiquity is like introducing a sneer at a lady’s age. It
              is caddish because it is irrelevant. The pure modernist is merely a
              snob; he cannot bear to be a month behind the fashion.

              Similarly I find that I have tried in these pages to express the real
              objection to philanthropists and have not succeeded. I have not seen
              the quite simple objection to the causes advocated by certain wealthy
              idealists; causes of which the cause called teetotalism is the
              strongest case. I have used many abusive terms about the thing, calling
              it Puritanism, or superciliousness, or aristocracy; but I have not seen
              and stated the quite simple objection to philanthropy; which is that it
              is religious persecution. Religious persecution does not consist in
              thumbscrews or fires of Smithfield; the essence of religious
              persecution is this: that the man who happens to have material power in
              the State, either by wealth or by official position, should govern his
              fellow-citizens not according to their religion or philosophy, but
              according to his own. If, for instance, there is such a thing as a
              vegetarian nation; if there is a great united mass of men who wish to
              live by the vegetarian morality, then I say in the emphatic words of
              the arrogant French marquis before the French Revolution, “Let them eat
              grass.” Perhaps that French oligarch was a humanitarian; most oligarchs
              are. Perhaps when he told the peasants to eat grass he was recommending
              to them the hygienic simplicity of a vegetarian restaurant. But that is
              an irrelevant, though most fascinating, speculation. The point here is
              that if a nation is really vegetarian let its government force upon it
              the whole horrible weight of vegetarianism. Let its government give the
              national guests a State vegetarian banquet. Let its government, in the
              most literal and awful sense of the words, give them beans. That sort
              of tyranny is all very well; for it is the people tyrannising over all
              the persons. But “temperance reformers” are like a small group of
              vegetarians who should silently and systematically act on an ethical
              assumption entirely unfamiliar to the mass of the people. They would
              always be giving peerages to greengrocers. They would always be
              appointing Parliamentary Commissions to enquire into the private life
              of butchers. Whenever they found a man quite at their mercy, as a
              pauper or a convict or a lunatic, they would force him to add the final
              touch to his inhuman isolation by becoming a vegetarian. All the meals
              for school children will be vegetarian meals. All the State public
              houses will be vegetarian public houses. There is a very strong case
              for vegetarianism as compared with teetotalism. Drinking one glass of
              beer cannot by any philosophy be drunkenness; but killing one animal
              can, by this philosophy, be murder. The objection to both processes is
              not that the two creeds, teetotal and vegetarian, are not admissible;
              it is simply that they are not admitted. The thing is religious
              persecution because it is not based on the existing religion of the
              democracy. These people ask the poor to accept in practice what they
              know perfectly well that the poor would not accept in theory. That is
              the very definition of religious persecution. I was against the Tory
              attempt to force upon ordinary Englishmen a Catholic theology in which
              they do not believe. I am even more against the attempt to force upon
              them a Mohamedan morality which they actively deny.

              Again, in the case of anonymous journalism I seem to have said a great
              deal without getting out the point very clearly. Anonymous journalism
              is dangerous, and is poisonous in our existing life simply because it
              is so rapidly becoming an anonymous life. That is the horrible thing
              about our contemporary atmosphere. Society is becoming a secret
              society. The modern tyrant is evil because of his elusiveness. He is
              more nameless than his slave. He is not more of a bully than the
              tyrants of the past; but he is more of a coward. The rich publisher may
              treat the poor poet better or worse than the old master workman treated
              the old apprentice. But the apprentice ran away and the master ran
              after him. Nowadays it is the poet who pursues and tries in vain to fix
              the fact of responsibility. It is the publisher who runs away. The
              clerk of Mr. Solomon gets the sack: the beautiful Greek slave of the
              Sultan Suliman also gets the sack; or the sack gets her. But though she
              is concealed under the black waves of the Bosphorus, at least her
              destroyer is not concealed. He goes behind golden trumpets riding on a
              white elephant. But in the case of the clerk it is almost as difficult
              to know where the dismissal comes from as to know where the clerk goes
              to. It may be Mr. Solomon or Mr. Solomon’s manager, or Mr. Solomon’s
              rich aunt in Cheltenham, or Mr. Soloman’s rich creditor in Berlin. The
              elaborate machinery which was once used to make men responsible is now
              used solely in order to shift the responsibility. People talk about the
              pride of tyrants; but we in this age are not suffering from the pride
              of tyrants. We are suffering from the shyness of tyrants; from the
              shrinking modesty of tyrants. Therefore we must not encourage
              leader-writers to be shy; we must not inflame their already exaggerated
              modesty. Rather we must attempt to lure them to be vain and
              ostentatious; so that through ostentation they may at last find their
              way to honesty.

              The last indictment against this book is the worst of all. It is simply
              this: that if all goes well this book will be unintelligible gibberish.
              For it is mostly concerned with attacking attitudes which are in their
              nature accidental and incapable of enduring. Brief as is the career of
              such a book as this, it may last just twenty minutes longer than most
              of the philosophies that it attacks. In the end it will not matter to
              us whether we wrote well or ill; whether we fought with flails or
              reeds. It will matter to us greatly on what side we fought.
